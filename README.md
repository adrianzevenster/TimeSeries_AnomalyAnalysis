# Time Series Anomolies Dections

The presented tasks aim to identify an anomaly detection mechanism on time series data.
Should there be a sudden or drastic fluctuation from expected statistical measures, these values should be predicted (or flagged) as potential issues which require action or investigation.

Step 1: Data Formating, Cleaning and Exploration
-> Testing and Training dataset data cleaning and formatting
--> Addressing NaN values in Class labels
--> Timestamp conversions

-> Visualization
--> Graphing <timestamp> and <eventTime> data
--> Overlaying Class column labels on train & test data
